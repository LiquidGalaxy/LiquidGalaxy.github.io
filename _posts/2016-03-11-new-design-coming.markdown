With the closing of [Google Code][google-code], we have begun to reorganize our
community efforts around a new [Github Organization][lg-github]. We hope the
popular social coding site will help new developers feel encouraged to open
issues, clone repos, and propose changes.

Additionally, this site will be getting a functional design to help users find
documentation, issues in progress, migrated wiki pages, and cool code hosted by
other groups.
